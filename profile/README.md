<h3 align="center">🔒 An open-source security configuration compliance solution</h3>

### 📣 Description

Rustguard aims to be an easy to use multi-platform solution to audit and apply security measures on your whole infrastructure.

With a server-client relationship, the web interface will allow to :
- easily configure the measures to be applied according to a pre-defined list, by you, or not
- watch in real-time your infrastructure compliance
